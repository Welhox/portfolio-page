          I am Casimir “Casi” Lundberg, a aviation professional who decided to follow a long-time passion for software development. Aviation has taught me precision, responsibility, and teamwork, but these days my focus is all about code.
        <br /><br />
          To make the switch, I went through the 42 core curriculum at Hive Helsinki (2023–2025), where I built a solid foundation in C and C++ with hands-on projects. That low-level training gave me a strong programming mindset and the confidence to pick up new tools quickly.
        <br /><br />
          Right now I am working mostly with TypeScript, React, Node.js, Fastify and Python. I love tackling tricky problems, building full-stack applications, and learning whatever new tech a project throws at me.
