          I am Casimir "Casi" Lundberg, a full-stack developer who brings precision and problem-solving from aviation to code. After years in the industry, I followed a long-time passion and made the leap into software development.
        <br /><br />
          I went through the 42 core curriculum at Hive Helsinki (2023‚Äì2025), where I built everything from scratch: memory allocators, shell implementations, and web servers. That foundation in C and C++ taught me how software actually works under the hood and gave me the confidence to pick up any new technology a project demands.
        <br /><br />
          These days I work with TypeScript, React, Node.js, Fastify, Python, and C/C++. I enjoy diving into complex problems, whether that's optimizing performance, debugging tricky issues, or building features from the ground up. There's nothing quite like the satisfaction of finally tracking down that elusive bug or solving a problem you've been wrestling with for hours.
